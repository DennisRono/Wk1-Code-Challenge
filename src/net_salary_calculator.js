 * Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
 *
 * Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.
 * Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
 *
 * NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
